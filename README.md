# Reclaim-the-Iron-Throne ⚔️⚔️
 
  Rhaenyra Targaryen, the first-born child of King Viserys I Targaryen, was considered the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. She was going to rule all the Westeros but her half-brother, Aegon Targaryen, seized the throne by force. 👑
  
  Rhaenyra is now determined to reclaim the Iron Throne from Aegon. However, she heard from her consultants that Aegon started to gather support from all corners of Westeros to maintain his power. She knows that in order to defeat Aegon, she needs to prevent him from gathering enough support. So she trusts your algorithm skills and asks me to help her take her rightful place as queen. 💻
  
  Aegon’s main purpose is to construct the biggest army with soldiers from all the regions in King’s Landing. He began by sending envoys to The Reach, Riverlands, Dorne, The Vale of Arryn, The Westerlands, and The Stormlands, offering alliances and promises of rewards in exchange for support (e.g. troops). He is pleased to receive enthusiastic responses from these 6 regions and begins to mobilize his forces. 🗺️
  
  The regions are willing to send all their troops to King’s Landing but because of limited transportation resources, there are a limited amount of troops that can reach the King’s Landing. But Aegon and his consultants know how to maximize the number of troops that can come to King’s Landing to support him. 🪖
  
  For Rhaenyra to defeat Aegon, she must first know the size of the troops he’s gathering in King’s Landing. Also, she wants to block the route of all the troops, so needs to know where to send her armies to. My duty is to give this crucial information to Rhaenyra using my algorithm knowledge. 🧑‍💻
